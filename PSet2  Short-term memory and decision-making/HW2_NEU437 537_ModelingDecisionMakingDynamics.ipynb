What happens to the reaction time and to the probability of `r1` being the winner as you change coherence `c`?\n","\n","<font color='red'>YOUR ANSWER IN TEXT HERE (3 pts)</font>\n","\n","2. What happens if you run with `noise_sigma=0, c=0`? What if you now make the noise really small, but non-zero, e.g., `noise_sigma=0.001`? What happens at very low coherence when the noise is very small, e.g., `noise_sigma=0.001, c=1`?\n","\n","<font color='red'>YOUR ANSWER IN TEXT HERE (3 pts)</font>\n","\n","3. Now let's try a little experiment. For each of the following values of `noise_sigma` (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1) try finding a value of `c` so that the probability of `r1` is approximately 0.75. What do you find? The value of `c` for which an experimental subject in a perceptual decision making task achieves a certain percent correct is sometimes called the subject's \"psychometric threshold.\" What would finding this value for a real experimental subject (say, in the random dot motion task) tell you about the level of noise affecting the subject's decision?

If you set the value of coherence high (e.g. `c=25`), how are the reaction times and probability of choosing `r1` affected as you increase the strength of mutual inhibition `wI` away from its default value (6.8)? For instance, try setting `wI=50` to see what that does. To see what's going on, it helps to set `maxiter=1000` so that each trial has more time to evolve and hit the decision bound. What do you see? How can you explain this?\n","\n","<font color='red'>YOUR ANSWER IN TEXT HERE (3 pts)</font>\n","\n","6.

For the default value of `wR=0`, no self-excitation, we can interpret each of the nullclines as the input-output function of the corresponding node, as described in lecture. For example, the blue line can be thought of as \"given a certain level of activity of `r1`, this is the stead-state value of `r2`\". Now run with much stronger self-excitation (and some stronger inhibition to balance that), as in `decisionMake(wR=6, wI=9)`. Is there still a one-to-one relationship between value of `r1` and value of `r2` on the blue line? What do you think happened?
